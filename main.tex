\begin{abstract}
Cryptocurrency as a commodity has proven to be quite volatile, making prediction of market trends highly valuable. Our team will leverage the constant stream of tweets discussing cryptocurrency on Twitter in order to build a model that can predict changes in a cryptocurrencyâ€™s value.

\section{Introduction}
Every day, Twitter users produce more than 500 million tweets. This makes Twitter an ideal resource for social sensing --- the use of humans as sensors. Users tweet and retweet about events, places, emotions, and more; the aggregation of this data has proven powerful for event detection and prediction. Cryptocurrency is a growing market that is both widely discussed and highly volatile, leading our team to believe that tweets may reflect trends in cryptocurrency value. Successfully using Twitter data to predict changes in cryptocurrency markets would provide a significant advantage in cryptocurrency trading. In this project, we will build a model to predict changes in the value of several major cryptocurrencies based on real-time data from Twitter.


\section{Approach}

\subsection{Data Sources}
Data for this project will come from Twitter. We will stream tweets using the Twitter API, which allows for tweets to be collected in near real-time. We will use the filtering capability of the Twitter API to only collect tweets that contain certain keywords\cite{sakai}. We have selected both general keywords (e.g. \code{cryptocurrency}, \code{altcoin}) and keywords for the specific cryptocurrencies we will be exploring (e.g. \code{bitcoin}, \code{BTC}, \code{ethereum}). If a tweet contains one or more of these keywords, our program will store the tweet body as well as important metadata (user ID, timestamp, retweets, favorites, etc.) in JSON format and append it to a data file.

\subsection{Methodology}
Once data is collected from Twitter, it will be cleaned, categorized, and used in a regression model to make predictions. Twitter data is noisy, so the first component of data processing will be to eliminate tweets that are not relevant to cryptocurrency. Our strategy for this task is to use a clustering algorithm to group tweets as relevant or noise. Because tweets are collected based on keywords, features for clustering include measures such as where in the tweet the keyword is located, or what words occur before and after the keyword. This method has been proven effective for removing irrelevant tweets3from a set of tweets collected during an event by keyword . A similar method will be used to categorize which cryptocurrencies a tweet is referring to.

Once noise is removed and tweets have associated currencies, data from the tweets will be used to calculate features in a regression algorithm predicting market trends for various currencies. Features may include number of tweets and sentiment/mood of tweets. First, we hope to take tweets from an entire day as input, and output the predicted change in currency value from one day to the next. After we have a strong model at this level, we will work on increasing granularity over time for our predictions. An ideal model would provide the predicted change in currency value every minute in order to influence trading decisions.

\section{Evaluation Plan}
Evaluation for our model relies on knowledge of actual cryptocurrency values over time, information which is readily available. Comparison of our predicted changes to actual changes can be calculated with statistical methods such as R\textsuperscript{2}. We look to maximize accuracy of our predictions and minimize the time needed to make a prediction. For the scope of this course, a successful project will consist of a final model that can take an input period no longer than one day and output an accurate prediction of change in value for a currency.
