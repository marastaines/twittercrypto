# twittercrypto

##Use:

$python tweet_scrape.py <output_file>

$python is_running.py

Note:

Pretty please use your own twitter account codes for OAuth if you're running tweet_scrape. If you don't have an account or whatever, I can send you mine, but I'm not gonna leave them in a public repo haha.

##Status:

tweet_scrape starts running fine, appending to output file. But when I check on it after a couple hours, the process is dead and the text file exists but with nothing in it.
